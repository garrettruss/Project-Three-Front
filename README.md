# MERN Stack Hikers Log

This single page app is designed for hikers to log entries in a personal journal to keep track of different hikes they have done and leave comments for their trip. It is themed for peak baggers to keep track of which mountains they have completed in a collection, such as the Appalachian Mountain Club's Four Thousand Footers club.  This app is made to educate individuals about the value of conservation and encourage them to get outside.

Current functionaliy:  Users can log in and create and read entries.
